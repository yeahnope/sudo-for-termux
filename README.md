# sudo-for-termux

A sudo script for termux. Seems to work well with lineagos. Compatibility with other roms/su binaries is unkown.

# Installation

1. Download the sudo file.
2. (Optional) Place the file somewhere in a $PATH directory (or make a new one and add it to $PATH)
3. chmod u+x sudo
3. Done! You can now use sudo :)
